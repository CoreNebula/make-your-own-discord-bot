## Prerequisites (What You Need)

- [X] A Discord Account
- [X] A Computer Running Windows or MacOS

While knowledge of coding is not required, some very basic knowledge of javascript will be helfull if you want really use the full potential of your bot.

The Discord account is kind of a given, but in order to run your bot you will need a computer. Windows and MacOS will both work, but as far as linux distributions go I am not sure. As long as you can install and use Node.js you should be fine.

## Making a Discord Application

Head over to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications) and under applications, create a new application. Creating this application is what allows you to connect your bot to Discord servers. You can give your application a name, which I would recommend being the same name you want to use for your bot.
