## Prerequisites (What You Need)
- [X] A Discord Account
- [X] A Computer Running Windows or MacOS

The Discord account is kind of a given, but in order to run your bot you will need a computer. Windows and MacOS will both work, but as far as linux distributions go I am not sure. As long as you can install and use Node.js you should be fine.
